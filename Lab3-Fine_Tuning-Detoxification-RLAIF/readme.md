In this notebook, you will fine-tune a FLAN-T5 model to generate less toxic content by Facebook's hate speech reward model. The reward model is a binary classifier that predicts either "not hate" or "hate" for the given text. You will use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune and detoxify the model.
